Tyk Gateway Docker
=================================

This container only contains the Tyk OSS API Gateway, the Tyk Dashboard is provided as a separate container and needs to be configured separately.

Tyk will run with a default configuration unless it has been overridden with the `-v` flag. Two sample configurations have been provided to run the Tyk Gateway as standalone (no DB or dashboard, file-based configurations) or with the Tyk Dashboard and MongoDB.

# Installation


## Docker-Compose

With docker-compose, simply run 
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

This will run both Tyk GW & Redis.  It mounts two directories, `middleware` and `apps` to add your APIs as well as your custom plugins.

## Docker

### Configure a network

```
docker network create tyk
ab1084d034c7e95735e10de804fc54aa940c031d2c4bb91d984675e5de2755e7

docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
---snip---
ab1084d034c7        tyk                 bridge              local
```

### Redis Dependency

You will need a local Redis container or external Redis server for the Gateway to communicate with.

In a production environment, we would recommend that Redis is highly available and deployed as a cluster.

```
# NOT FOR PRODUCTION
docker pull redis:4.0-alpine
docker run -itd --rm --name redis --network tyk -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 redis:4.0-alpine

docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                        NAMES
b713c61fd8fe        redis:4.0-alpine    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   5 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds        127.0.0.1:6379->6379/tcp     redis
```

### Deploy Tyk Gateway

```
docker pull tykio/tyk-gateway:latest
```

Now that you have the Gateway locally, you will need to grab a configuration file. You may use `tyk.standalone.conf` or
`tyk.with_dashboard.conf` from https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker as a base template using the
appropriate version for your use-case.

Documentation for gateway configuration can be found here: https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-configuration-reference/tyk-gateway-configuration-options/

Alternatively, should you wish to configure tyk using environment variables, see https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-configuration-reference/environment-variables/ for details of how our environment variables are constructed.

Please note that you should set the Gateway secret in the `TYK_GW_SECRET` environment variable.  If you do not, the entrypoint script will attempt to set `TYK_GW_SECRET` environment variable from the value of `secret` in tyk.conf.

```
TYK_GW_SECRET=foo
```

We will now run the Gateway by mounting our modified `tyk.conf`.

## Custom Plugins
Remember to modify your `tyk.conf` to include the required global parameters, essentially:

```json
"enable_jsvm": true,
"coprocess_options": {
  "enable_coprocess": true,
},
"enable_bundle_downloader": true,
"bundle_base_url": "http://my-bundle-server.com/bundles/",
```
